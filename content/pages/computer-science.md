Computer science is the study of computers and computing and their theoretical and practical applications. In a way, computer science is to software engineering as biology is to bioengineering. However, many people who study computer science work as software engineers, and many (or even most) software engineers studied computer science. As a result, we include it in this list of engineering categories because it is ever so slightly different than software engineering.
