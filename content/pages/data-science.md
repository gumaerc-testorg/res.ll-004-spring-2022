Data science is the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data to drive insight and solutions to a given problem. It involves skills from several disciplines, including mathematics, computer science, algorithms, statistical analysis, and artificial intelligence/machine learning. It is one of the fastest growing careers because of the high demand for data analysis skills; artificial intelligence growth is helping to drive this trend.
