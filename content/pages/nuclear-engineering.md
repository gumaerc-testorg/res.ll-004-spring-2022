Nuclear engineering covers nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and efficient and safe nuclear power. The field of nuclear engineering develops uses for nuclear materials for medical diagnostic equipment, food production, radioactive-waste disposal, powering nuclear submarines and thousands of homes while reducing the need for petrochemicals, and more.

### Specializations:

- Nuclear energy and radiation
- Nuclear fuel cycle (production, handling, and use of nuclear fuel and safe disposal of waste)
- Nuclear power for naval vessels and spacecraft
- Industrial and medical uses for radioactive materials
- Designing, constructing, and operating nuclear facilities
- Examining nuclear accidents and using data to design preventative measures

### Skills:

- Math (statistics, advanced algebra, calculus, trigonometry, geometry)
- Sciences (chemistry, biology, physics)
- Programming
- Reactor operations and safety
- Sustainable/renewable energies
- Modeling and simulation
- Electromagnetic interactions
- Nuclear materials
