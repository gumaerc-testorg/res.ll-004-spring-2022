Software engineers bring the application of engineering concepts for software development. They create, improve, and maintain software. This can include the software that runs your phone, or a spaceship, or a factory, or fights cybercrime. Software engineers are responsible for the lifecycle of a software product from conception to testing to production to upgrades.

### **Specializations:**

- Embedded software engineering
- Computer graphics
- Cybersecurity
- Front-end application development
- Back-end application development
- Quality assurance (QA)
- Development and Operations (DevOps)
- Web development
- Software architecture
- Artificial intelligence/machine learning

### **Skills:**

- Math (discrete math, statistics, calculus, geometry)
- Programming languages (often multiple, e.g., Python, C++, Java)
- Algorithmic analysis
- Software testing
- Software tooling (e.g., git, integrated development environments)
