Study of how **electricity**, **electronics,** and **electromagnetism** are applied to real-life problems. Electrical engineers design, test, and develop electrical and electronic systems as well as the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment and devices. This field covers a wide range of technologies ranging from electric motors to GPS to communications systems to space equipment. However, if youâ€™re interested in computer hardware, that is included in computer hardware engineering, not electronic engineering.
